                        civil law, codified statutes and ordinances rule the land.

                        Divorce, or "dissolution of marriage," is the legal termination of the marital relationship. The
                        divorce process is handled by family law attorneys (each estranged spouse retains his or her own
                        counsel) and involves a number of issues, ranging from division of property to child custody.

                        <br><br>

                        Hinduism places a very high value on marriage and does not approve of divorce. In practice,
                        however, it is recognised that marriages do not always work and divorces do take place.
                        Faithfulness within marriage is expected, and adultery is not approved of. Self-control is an
                        important aspect of Hindu teaching.

                        spouse (the petitioner) and served on the other spouse. The petition is then filed in a state
                        court in the county where one of the spouses resides.
